    The sound of rain tapping against the window was soothing, a rhythmic melody that filled the quiet room. A steaming cup of tea sat on the table, its warmth radiating through the ceramic mug. Outside, the world seemed washed clean, with trees swaying gently in the breeze and puddles forming along the sidewalk. Inside, the air smelled faintly of lavender from a nearby candle, blending perfectly with the calm atmosphere. It was the kind of moment that invited reflection, a pause from the rush of daily life to simply enjoy the present.
